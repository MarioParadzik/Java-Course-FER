This repository contains solved homework problems from the **Java Course 1** at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, held by lecturer doc. dr. sc. Marko Čupić.

## Homework 1 - Custom Collections
* implemented a custom array-backed and linked-list-backed collections

## Homework 2 - Lexer and Parser
* implemented a lexer and a parser for a custom script language

## Homework 3 - Hash Table
implemented a custom hash table collection

## Homework 4 - Simple Database
* wrote a simple database emulator which allows query commands for fetching various items from the database

## Homework 5 - Files
* created a program which allows encryption and decryption of files using the AES algorithm and offers calculation and verification of the SHA-256 file digest.
* implemented a custom shell interface, MyShell, with which the user can interact with. This is a list of available commands:
  * cat - writes the contents of the given file
  * copy - copies the given file to another location
  * exit - terminates the shell
  * help - help instructions for the specified command 
  * ls - lists all files and directories of the given directory
  * tree - writes a tree structure of the given directory of all his files and directorys
  * mkdir - creates a new directory on the inputed location
  * symbol - prints out or replaces the shell prompt symbol 
  * hexdump - dumps a hex representation of the contents of the given file
  * charsets - lists all available system charsets

## Homework 6 - Multithreading
* implemented a simple library for working with 3D vectors, complex numbers and polynomials
* using the previously written complex number and polynomial libraries, implemented an algorithm for calculating Newton-Raphson fractals and displaying the obtained result visually
* using the 3D vector library, implemented a ray-caster for rendering 3D scenes and visually displaying the obtained result

## Homework 7 - Introduction to Swing
* implemented a custom layout manager
* implemented a custom calculator which supports default and advanced calculating operations 
* implemented a bar chart for dynamically displaying a collection of (x, y) pairs

## Homework 8 - Simple Text Editor
* created JNotepad++ - a simple Notepad++ clone with the following funcionality:
  * creating a new blank document,
  * opening existing document,
  * saving adn save-as document,
  * cut/copy/paste text,
  * statistical info,
* implemented internationalization (i18n): the program supports Croatian, English and German languages
